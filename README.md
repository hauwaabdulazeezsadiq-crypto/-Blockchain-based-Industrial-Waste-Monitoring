# 🌍 Blockchain-based Industrial Waste Monitoring

Welcome to a decentralized platform built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts! This project empowers industries, regulators, and environmental agencies to transparently monitor and verify industrial waste disposal processes. By leveraging blockchain's immutability, it ensures compliance with environmental regulations, reduces illegal dumping, and promotes sustainable practices through verifiable records and incentives.

## ✨ Features

📋 Register companies, waste facilities, and regulators with verified identities  
🗑️ Log detailed waste disposal events with timestamps and geolocation data  
✅ Automated compliance checks against predefined environmental regulations  
📊 Generate tamper-proof reports for audits and public transparency  
💰 Incentive system rewarding compliant disposals with tokens  
⚖️ Penalty mechanisms for non-compliance, enforced on-chain  
🔍 Public verification tools for stakeholders to audit disposal history  
🚫 Prevent fraudulent or duplicate logging through unique hashes  
🌐 Integration with IoT devices for real-time data feeds (off-chain oracles)

## 🛠 How It Works

This platform uses 8 interconnected Clarity smart contracts to create a robust ecosystem for waste monitoring. Each contract handles a specific aspect of the platform, ensuring modularity, security, and scalability. Here's a breakdown:

### Smart Contracts Overview

1. **UserRegistry.clar**: Manages registration of participants (e.g., industrial companies, waste disposal facilities, regulators). Stores user profiles, roles, and verifies identities via STX addresses.
   
2. **WasteTypeRegistry.clar**: Defines categories of industrial waste (e.g., hazardous chemicals, recyclables) and associated regulations (e.g., max disposal limits, required treatments). Allows regulators to update rules via governance.

3. **DisposalEventLogger.clar**: Records waste disposal events with details like waste type, quantity, location (hashed for privacy), timestamp, and proof-of-disposal (e.g., IoT sensor hash). Ensures events are immutable.

4. **ComplianceVerifier.clar**: Automatically checks logged events against regulations from WasteTypeRegistry. Flags non-compliant disposals and triggers alerts or penalties.

5. **ReportGenerator.clar**: Aggregates data from logs to create compliance reports for specific users or time periods. Reports are hashed and stored on-chain for verifiable sharing.

6. **IncentiveDistributor.clar**: Issues reward tokens (e.g., ECO tokens) to compliant companies based on verified disposals. Uses a staking mechanism to encourage long-term sustainability.

7. **PenaltyEnforcer.clar**: Applies on-chain penalties for violations, such as token burns or locked funds. Regulators can enforce based on verified non-compliance.

8. **AuditTrail.clar**: Provides query functions for external audits, allowing public or authorized users to verify the entire chain of events without revealing sensitive data.

### For Industrial Companies

- Register your company via UserRegistry.
- Log a disposal event using DisposalEventLogger, providing:
  - Waste type and quantity.
  - A unique hash from IoT sensors or disposal proofs.
  - Geolocation data (optional, hashed for privacy).
- The ComplianceVerifier automatically checks your submission.
- If compliant, earn rewards via IncentiveDistributor!

Boom! Your disposal is now transparently recorded and rewarded.

### For Regulators and Auditors

- Update regulations in WasteTypeRegistry (governance-protected).
- Use ComplianceVerifier to flag issues and trigger PenaltyEnforcer.
- Generate reports with ReportGenerator for official audits.
- Verify any event or user history instantly via AuditTrail.

That's it! Real-time compliance monitoring with blockchain-backed trust.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Set up a Stacks wallet and install the Clarity development tools.
2. Deploy the contracts in sequence (start with UserRegistry).
3. Interact via the Stacks explorer or build a frontend dApp for user-friendly access.
4. Integrate oracles for real-world data (e.g., waste sensor feeds).

This platform solves the real-world problem of opaque waste disposal practices, which often lead to environmental pollution and regulatory evasion. By making data immutable and verifiable, it fosters accountability and sustainability. Let's build a greener future! 🌱
